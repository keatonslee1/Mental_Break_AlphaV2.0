    "description": "A small apartment corner where Timmy keeps his personal workstation. A battered desk holds an old computer with an external hard drive, surrounded by coffee mugs and sticky notes. A window looks out over the city lights, with curtains drawn to keep the glow in. Warm, muted lighting and personal clutter convey a sense of refuge after the chaos of the runs.",
