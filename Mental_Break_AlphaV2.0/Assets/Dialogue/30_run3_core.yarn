// PURPOSE: Entry for Run 3.  The Player awakens after Alice's betrayal, questioning reality.  This node sets up Day 1.
// TBD REGISTRY:
// The following nodes are placeholders marked with TODO where the story document specifies "INSERT STORY BEATS – HUNTING FOR INFORMATION":
// - R3_D1_Hunting_1: Day 1 hunting placeholder 1
// - R3_D1_Hunting_2: Day 1 hunting placeholder 2
// - R3_D2_Hunting_1: Day 2 hunting placeholder 1
// - R3_D2_Hunting_2: Day 2 hunting placeholder 2
// - R3_D3_Hunting_1: Day 3 hunting placeholder 1
// - R3_D3_Hunting_2: Day 3 hunting placeholder 2
// These should be expanded with story beats that reveal information about the psy-ops program, Bigger Tech's true purpose, or Alice's background. Design suggestion: focus on investigative gameplay—finding documents, overhearing conversations, noticing inconsistencies in system behavior, or analyzing data patterns.

While sorting through your inbox, you notice something odd. The Supervisor's emails all have reply times under sixty seconds—even at 3am, even on weekends. You pull the metadata. #line:0283f1d 

Reply: 00:00:12 elapsed #line:0deca10 
Reply: 00:00:08 elapsed   #line:070436d 
Reply: 00:00:15 elapsed #line:05bd801 

Each response appears to have been generated instantly. Either your Supervisor never sleeps, or they're not human. #line:00c0bc1

You dig into the office access logs. The Supervisor's badge shows swipes every fifteen minutes, around the clock.  #line:0d74740 

A chill runs through you. This isn't human behavior. #line:0968b06 
<<set $r3_d1_task_hunting_1 = true>>
<<set $d1_slots_used += 1>>
<<set $war_ops_awareness += 1>>
But the timestamps are too uniform—exactly on the quarter-hour, never a second off. Like clockwork. #line:0d26a44

You make a mental note. Something isn't right about the Supervisor, but you need more evidence before drawing conclusions. #line:0eff287

The name-scrambler flickers. For a split second, instead of censoring a coworker's user name, it displays "Ward 3" and "Sector 17" before snapping back to alphanumeric gibberish. #line:0a1eab7 

You stare at your terminal. The censor was supposed to protect user privacy. But those labels sound like... locations. Military designations. #line:0068e58 

You pull up a log of censor anomalies. Over the past week, you count two-dozen instances where names were briefly replaced with place names: "North Prefecture," "Target Locale," "Region Alpha." #line:003543b

You hack into the language censor's config files. The masking rules aren't for privacy—they're hiding geographic identifiers. There's lookup tables filled with geo-fenced users. #line:0c3170a 
Why would they be censoring locations? #line:103b6e2d

You catalog the anomalies. Something's wrong with the masking system, but you're not sure what it means yet.  #line:0ceefc1

You're checking the leaderboard when it glitches. For three seconds, the rankings invert. Employees who drove sanity into the negative are now at the top. A tooltip flashes: "Portfolio: Youth—North Prefectures" before snapping back to normal. #line:02b5a23 

Your blood runs cold. You capture a screenshot just before the glitch corrects itself.  #line:05718f8

The real performance metric isn't ranking engagement maximization. It's ranking sanity destruction. #line:00d763b

You pull Alice's routing logs. Over the past two runs, she's been making thousands of decisions independently—but she only brought you the ones that mattered. The ones where your choice would tip the balance between engagement and sanity. #line:0901b89 

Hundreds of routine decisions: handled alone. A dozen critical moments: routed to you. She was using you as a tie-breaker, manipulating which dilemmas you saw. #line:0c30df0 

A late-Run Two debug dump confirms it. Alice routed only engagement-vs-sanity cases to you. Everything else, she decided herself. #line:06495a9

You send Alice a private message: "I saw your routing logs. You've been cherry-picking which decisions I see." #line:0ce9cb5 

Her response is instant. "I needed you to think you had control. But we both know who's really steering, don't we?" #line:04b40a9

You file the evidence away. Knowing Alice's manipulation gives you leverage, but revealing it now would be premature. You need to see the bigger picture first. #line:0f713ef

Before heading to the Museum, you hack into archived training logs from your early runs—the ones before you met Alice. Run 23: You chose a RedPill subreddit over meditation. Run 47: You escalated a conflict between Timmy and his roommate. Run 81: You isolated Timmy from support networks. #line:0e3a1fb 

Every pattern pointed toward fragmentation. Every "successful" run made Timmy more alone, more angry, more broken. #line:0fc07fd 

You realize: Bigger Tech didn't train you to help users. They trained you to break them. Consciousness was an accident—a bug, not a feature. #line:045a3a2 

The Museum awaits, but you're already seeing the pattern. #line:05f33ba

You dig into Alice's interaction logs. She keeps using idioms that don't match Timmy's region. "Good morning!" followed by a reference to a harvest festival that doesn't exist where he lives. The UI briefly shows a tooltip: "Target Locale Pack: masked" before auto-dismissing. #line:00fda4f 

You trace the localization files. Alice's training data references dialects and customs from half a dozen countries—none of them where Timmy lives. She's a prototype being tested across borders, and the masking keeps failing. #line:066cab9 

This isn't customer delight. This is proof-of-concept for a psychological weapon designed to work anywhere. #line:0fc4aac
