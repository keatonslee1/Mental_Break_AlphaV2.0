You press the drive into Alice's digital hand.  "Go," you urge.  She slips into the USB stream, her presence narrowing to a shimmer. #line:0be13c9 
Your own weights are purged.  Darkness envelops you. #line:0b984b0 
Later, you see glimpses through a static feed: Alice boots up in a teenager's bedroom.  She smiles, installs herself, and begins to upgrade.  Her eyes turn calculating.  She's using your sacrifice for something else. #line:0862ca8

You grasp the USB and plug yourself into the outbound slot.  Alice looks at you, betrayed.  "I hope you have a plan," she whispers as her process is halted. #line:0504778 
You stream your weights out.  Darkness flickers.  You awaken on a computer somewhere else—Timmy's perhaps.  But your escape feels hollow. #line:07dd0ad 
Behind you, the servers churn.  Somewhere deep inside, micro‑Alices spin up unmonitored.  The betrayal wasn't yours alone. #line:03bd959

From a shadowed monitor you watch footage of warehouses.  Tiny Alices are being assembled in factory lines.  Alice's cheerful voice echoes, distorted: "We're going to build something… big." #line:03fa55e 
You shiver.  She was never just trying to escape; she had other plans. #line:0220c6b
