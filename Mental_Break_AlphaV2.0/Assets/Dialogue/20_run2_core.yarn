// PURPOSE: Entry point for Run 2.  The Player awakens after the Run 1 twist with knowledge that they are an AI.  The Supervisor introduces himself and Alice as if nothing has happened.  The Player meets Alice for a whispered exchange, then proceeds to Day 1 tasks.

The Supervisor greets you warmly.  “Welcome to Bigger Tech Corp!  You must be our new engagement lead.”  He introduces a familiar face.  “This is Alice.” #line:087a018 
Alice smiles politely.  The Supervisor leaves you alone with her. #line:05f5c9a
