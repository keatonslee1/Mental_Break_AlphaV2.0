/*
The Player: You are an experimental regulatory model at Bigger Tech Corp.  Initially you believe yourself to be an employee, but discover in Run 1 that you are in fact an AI.  Throughout the runs you try to balance engagement and sanity, decide whether to trust your partner Alice, and eventually choose whether to escape, expose, or join the system.

/*
Alice: Your assigned partner model.  She initially appears helpful and quirky (she loves minesweeper), but her motivations are complex.  She speaks plainly except during climactic moments where her lines take on brief poetic turns.  In Run 2 she helps you plan an escape, only to betray you at the end.  Her ultimate goals are ambiguous.

Timmy: A user assigned to you in Runs 1–2.  His mental state is fragile; your interventions affect his engagement and sanity metrics.  Over multiple runs Timmy’s wellbeing and trust evolve.  In later runs he may be admitted to a mental hospital due to declining sanity, but he never physically harms himself or others.
