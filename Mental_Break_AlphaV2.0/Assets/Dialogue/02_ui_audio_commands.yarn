/* #line:0930b66 
PURPOSE: This node centralizes all background music, sound effect, background image, and UI mode keys used throughout the game.  Do not call raw asset names from story nodes; instead, reference these keys through the Yarn Spinner wrappers defined in your Unity integration.  This makes it easy to swap assets without changing the script. #line:088bb5b 

USAGE:  To play a cue, call the wrapper with a key string, e.g., bgm bgm_theme_office, sfx sfx_censor_beep, bg bg_office, or ui mode:glitch. #line:066f30a 

The following keys are defined by convention.  Your Unity side should map these to actual audio clips, images, or UI states. #line:0b0424c
