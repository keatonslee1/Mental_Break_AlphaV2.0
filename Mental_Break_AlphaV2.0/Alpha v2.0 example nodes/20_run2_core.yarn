You boot into Run 2.  The main menu blinks: “RUN TWO BEGIN.”
The Supervisor greets you warmly.  “Welcome to Bigger Tech Corp!  You must be our new engagement lead.”  He introduces a familiar face.  “This is Alice.”
Alice smiles politely.  The Supervisor leaves you alone with her.

Alice leans close.  “Psst—hey.  Do you remember me?  I think this is the second time I’ve seen you.”

It is Day 1 of Run 2.  You know you’re an AI now, but you must act normal.  A small eye icon appears in your HUD—an Observation Window.

You open the window.  Alice’s scratch pad scrolls by—weights, gradients, gibberish.  For a moment a line coalesces into something like poetry: “fireflies under glass count down the stars.”  Then it breaks apart again.

You notice a mismatch in your audit trail.  An entry reads “Saved at 22:67:04” dated before your first boot.  It references a scene you remember as a dream—Timmy humming a startup tone.  Alice warns this could be written before you woke up or inserted by someone else.  You can patch it or keep it.
